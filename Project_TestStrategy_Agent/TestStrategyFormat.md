The objective is to test the end-to-end functionality, usability and performance of {{the application / feature under test}} and ensure it meets the business and technical requirements.

4. Scope
In scope
{{List the workflows, modules, and capabilities to be tested.}}
Example (ecommerce):

All customer workflows - search, browse, add to cart, checkout, payments
Account registration and management
Order management and tracking
Integration with payment gateways
Admin module and workflows
Web and mobile site
Out of scope
{{List what will NOT be tested and why.}}
Example (ecommerce):

5. Test Levels & Types
Unit testing — {{owned by dev; component-level}}
Integration testing — interfaces between modules/services
API / backend testing — contract, request/response, status codes, error handling
System / end-to-end testing — complete business workflows
Regression testing — protect existing functionality after changes
Smoke / sanity testing — build-acceptance and quick health checks
User Acceptance Testing (UAT) — business sign-off
6. Focus Areas / Quality Attributes
Functional correctness of flows
UI / navigation
Performance - load, stress and scalability
Security - vulnerabilities, encryption
Compatibility - browsers, devices, OS
Usability - ease of use, accessibility
7. Test Approach
Black box and white box testing techniques
Risk-based prioritization of test scenarios
Automated test cases using {{Selenium / Playwright}} and {{Appium}} (mobile)
API / backend automation using {{Postman / RestAssured}}
Exploratory testing for key workflows
Automation vs. manual split: automate stable, repetitive, high-value regression flows; keep exploratory, one-off, and rapidly-changing areas manual
Framework design: Page Object Model (POM) / BDD (Cucumber), reusable components, data-driven tests
CI integration: automated suites triggered on each build/PR via {{CI/CD tool}}
Load testing with {{JMeter}} for at least {{1000}} concurrent users
Security testing for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
Cross browser compatibility testing on {{Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari}}
Ease of use evaluation with at least {{10}} end users

9. Test Data Management
Data sourcing / creation strategy: {{generated, masked production copy, fixtures}}
Test accounts / users: {{roles and credentials store}}
Sensitive data handling / masking: {{PII, payment data}}
Domain-specific data: {{e.g. payment test cards, sample catalog, addresses}}
Data refresh / reset cadence: {{per cycle / on demand}}

Manual / Functional Tester(s)	Test design, execution, exploratory testing
Automation Engineer(s)	Framework, automated suites, CI integration
Performance Tester	Load/stress scripts and analysis
Security Tester	Vulnerability & compliance testing
12. Schedule & Milestones
Proposed schedule ({{YEAR}}):

{{Month 1}} (April): Functional and security testing

{{Month 2}} (May): Load / performance testing

{{Month 3}} (June): Compatibility testing, UAT

{{Month 4}} (July): Regression testing

Milestones: {{test plan sign-off, cycle completion, go/no-go}}

Buffer / contingency: {{built-in slack for slippage and re-test}}

Estimation basis: {{how team size & duration were derived}}

13. Deliverables
Functional test cases and reports
Performance test scripts and results
Security vulnerabilities report
User acceptance testing report
Test coverage and defect reports
Automation regression suite
14. Entry, Exit, Suspension & Resumption Criteria
Entry criteria
User stories to be tested must meet the defined 'Ready for Testing' criteria.
{{Build deployed to the test environment; test data and environment available.}}
Exit criteria
Testing completes when all test cases execute with no critical defects outstanding.
{{Required coverage met; all high/critical defects closed or accepted by stakeholders.}}
Suspension criteria
{{Blocker defect, unstable build, or environment unavailable halts testing.}}
Resumption criteria
{{Blocker resolved / stable build redeployed before testing resumes.}}
15. Defect Management
Lifecycle: New → Assigned → In Progress → Fixed → Retest → Closed / Reopened
Severity (technical impact): Critical / High / Medium / Low
Priority (business urgency): P1 / P2 / P3 / P4
Triage cadence: {{daily / per cycle}} defect triage with dev + QA + PO
SLA: {{target turnaround per severity}}
Tracked in {{Jira}}.
16. Test Metrics & KPIs
Test case coverage % vs. requirements
Test execution pass / fail rate
Defect density and defect leakage (escaped defects)
Automation coverage %
Mean time to resolve (MTTR) defects
Reporting frequency: {{daily / weekly}} status reports & dashboards
17. Risks & Mitigation
Risk	Likelihood	Impact	Mitigation	Owner
Delay in test environment availability	{{M}}	{{H}}	{{Early provisioning, fallback env}}	{{}}
Lack of access to third party payment systems	{{M}}	{{H}}	{{Sandbox/mock services, early access requests}}	{{}}
Complex workflows may require more time and resources	{{M}}	{{M}}	{{Buffer in schedule, prioritize by risk}}	{{}}
18. Assumptions & Dependencies
Assumptions: {{stable requirements, environment uptime, timely builds}}
Dependencies: {{third-party services, upstream teams, test data providers}}
19. Communication & Reporting
Daily standups and {{weekly}} status reports
Stakeholders: {{PO, dev lead, QA lead, business owner}}
Channels: {{Jira dashboards, email summaries, demo/review meetings}}
20. Domain-Specific Considerations
Select and detail what applies to the feature under test:

Accessibility: comply with {{WCAG 2.1 / 2.2 AA}}; tools: axe, Lighthouse, screen readers
Security depth: authentication / authorization / session management; data privacy ({{GDPR}}); PCI-DSS if payments are involved; penetration testing
Performance depth: response-time SLAs, soak / endurance, spike (peak/flash events), scalability targets, monitoring / APM
Localization / i18n: multi-language, multi-currency, regional tax & compliance
Example domain (ecommerce):

Payments — multiple methods (cards, wallets, UPI, net banking, COD), refunds/chargebacks, declined/failed transactions, multi-currency
Cart / checkout — coupons & promos, tax & shipping calculation, abandoned cart, inventory race conditions / overselling
Inventory / stock — out-of-stock and back-in-stock flows
Search — relevance, filters, sorting, recommendations
Notifications — order confirmation, shipping updates, OTP/email
SEO and analytics / tracking validation
