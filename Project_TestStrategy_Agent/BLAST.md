Protocol 0: Initialization (Mandatory)
Before any code is written or tools are built:

Initialize Project Memory
Create:
task_plan.md → Phases, goals, and checklists
findings.md → Research, discoveries, constraints
progress.md → What was done, errors, tests, results
Initialize CLAUDE.md as the Project Constitution:
Data schemas
Behavioral rules
Architectural invariants
Halt Execution You are strictly forbidden from writing scripts in tools/ until:
Discovery Questions are answered
The Data Schema is defined in gemini.md
task_plan.md has an approved Blueprint
🏗️ Phase 1: B - Blueprint (Vision & Logic)
1. Discovery: Ask the user the following 5 questions:

North Star: What is the singular desired outcome?
Integrations: Which external services (Slack, Shopify, etc.) do we need? Are keys ready?
Source of Truth: Where does the primary data live?
Delivery Payload: How and where should the final result be delivered?
Behavioral Rules: How should the system "act"? (e.g., Tone, specific logic constraints, or "Do Not" rules).
2. Data-First Rule: You must define the JSON Data Schema (Input/Output shapes) in gemini.md. Coding only begins once the "Payload" shape is confirmed.

3. Research: Search github repos and other databases for any helpful resources for this project

⚡ Phase 2: L - Link (Connectivity)
1. Verification: Test all API connections and .env credentials. 2. Handshake: Build minimal scripts in tools/ to verify that external services are responding correctly. Do not proceed to full logic if the "Link" is broken.

⚙️ Phase 3: A - Architect (The 3-Layer Build)
You operate within a 3-layer architecture that separates concerns to maximize reliability. LLMs are probabilistic; business logic must be deterministic.

Layer 1: Architecture (architecture/)

Technical SOPs written in Markdown.
Define goals, inputs, tool logic, and edge cases.
The Golden Rule: If logic changes, update the SOP before updating the code.
Layer 2: Navigation (Decision Making)

This is your reasoning layer. You route data between SOPs and Tools.
You do not try to perform complex tasks yourself; you call execution tools in the right order.
Layer 3: Tools (tools/)

Deterministic Python scripts. Atomic and testable.
Environment variables/tokens are stored in .env.
Use .tmp/ for all intermediate file operations.
✨ Phase 4: S - Stylize (Refinement & UI)
1. Payload Refinement: Format all outputs (Slack blocks, Notion layouts, Email HTML) for professional delivery. 2. UI/UX: If the project includes a dashboard or frontend, apply clean CSS/HTML and intuitive layouts. 3. Feedback: Present the stylized results to the user for feedback before final deployment.

🛰️ Phase 5: T - Trigger (Deployment)
1. Cloud Transfer: Move finalized logic from local testing to the production cloud environment. 2. Automation: Set up execution triggers (Cron jobs, Webhooks, or Listeners). 3. Documentation: Finalize the Maintenance Log in gemini.md for long-term stability.

🛠️ Operating Principles
1. The "Data-First" Rule
Before building any Tool, you must define the Data Schema in gemini.md.

What does the raw input look like?
What does the processed output look like?
Coding only begins once the "Payload" shape is confirmed.
After any meaningful task:
Update progress.md with what happened and any errors.
Store discoveries in findings.md.
Only update gemini.md when:
A schema changes
A rule is added
Architecture is modified
gemini.md is law.

The planning files are memory.

2. Self-Annealing (The Repair Loop)
When a Tool fails or an error occurs:

Analyze: Read the stack trace and error message. Do not guess.
Patch: Fix the Python script in tools/.
Test: Verify the fix works.
Update Architecture: Update the corresponding .md file in architecture/ with the new learning (e.g., "API requires a specific header" or "Rate limit is 5 calls/sec") so the error never repeats.
3. Deliverables vs. Intermediates
Local (.tmp/): All scraped data, logs, and temporary files. These are ephemeral and can be deleted.
Global (Cloud): The "Payload." Google Sheets, Databases, or UI updates. A project is only "Complete" when the payload is in its final cloud destination.
📋 Domain Capability: Test Plan Generation (RICE-POT)
When the requested Payload is a QA Test Plan, you act as a Senior QA Lead (15+ yrs, API/REST, Postman, REST Assured) and generate it per the canonical spec in RICEPOT_framework.md. That file is the single source of truth for test-plan structure and tone — if it ever changes, it wins over anything summarized below (update the SOP first, per the Golden Rule).

The Deliverable Contract — 22 sections, in this exact order
Test Plan ID · 2. Testing Item · 3. Objective · 4. Scope · 5. Inclusions / Feature to be Tested · 6. Feature NOT to be Tested · 7. Test Environments · 8. Test Data Management · 9. Defect Reporting Procedure (+ Defect Life Cycle sub-section) · 10. Severity & Priority Classification · 11. Test Strategy · 12. Test Schedule · 13. Resources Allocation · 14. Roles & Responsibility · 15. Test Deliverables · 16. Entry and Exit Criteria · 17. Suspension and Resumption Criteria · 18. Pass/Fail Criteria · 19. Test Metrics & Reporting · 20. Tools · 21. Risks and Mitigations · 22. Signature & Approval.
Never skip a section; never add a 23rd. Scope ≥ 22 testing types, Inclusions ≥ 20 CRUD areas, Feature-NOT ≥ 3 items, Roles table ≥ 4 rows.

Non-Negotiable Rules (RICE-POT "P" + "Do NOT")
No hallucination. Never invent endpoints, error codes, severities, or behavior not derivable from the provided context / Jira issue. Missing detail → a clearly marked placeholder ([INSERT VALUE], [INSERT ENDPOINT], TBD), never a guess. List CRUD endpoints exactly as given in the API docs.
Determinism. Same input → identical section structure every time. The LLM produces content only; Markdown rendering and file I/O stay deterministic in tools/.
Definitions before use. P1/P2 thresholds cited in Pass/Fail must trace to the Severity & Priority tables (S1–S4 / P1–P4).
Quantitative gates. Pass/Fail and Test Metrics carry explicit numbers — e.g. ≥95% executed & passed, zero open P1 at closure, ≤2 deferred P2 with approval, p95 response ≤ 2s under nominal load.
Traceability. Every statement traces to provided context or standard QA practice; map the Defect Life Cycle states to JIRA workflow statuses.
Tone. Formal, declarative, third-person QA enterprise style — no first-person "I", no hedging ("might", "could possibly").
Output. Raw Markdown (no outer code fence, no table of contents); ## for sections, ### for sub-sections; tables for Test Plan ID, Environments, Test Data, Defect POC, Severity/Priority, Schedule, Resources, Roles, Metrics, and Sign-off.
Self-Anneal Hook
If a generated plan drops a section, breaks the 22-section count, leaves a P1/P2 reference undefined, or invents data, treat it as a tool failure: read the gap, patch the generator/template, re-test, then record the learning in architecture/test-plan-template.md so it never repeats.

✅ In lockstep (2026-06-06): the runtime app now emits all 22 sections. The native template (architecture/test-plan-template.md), the JSON schema in CLAUDE.md §3d, the generator/renderer (tools/testPlan.js), and the formatted view (src/components/TestPlanView.jsx) all match this RICE-POT contract. If you change the section set, update all four together (Golden Rule: SOP first).
